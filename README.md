# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics in easy-to-understand form, often with visual graphs,
without using a statistical model or having formulated a hypothesis. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians visually to examine their data
sets, to formulate hypotheses that could be tested on new data-sets.

Tukey's championing of EDA encouraged the development of statistical computing packages, especially S at Bell Labs. The S programming language inspired the systems 'S'-PLUS and R.
This family of statistical-computing environments featured vastly improved dynamic visualization capabilities, which allowed statisticians to identify outliers, trends and
patterns in data that merited further study.

The above folder are the data analysis performed on the dataset for practice purpose.
